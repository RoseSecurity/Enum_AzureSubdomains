# :cloud: Enum_AzureSubdomains:

A Metasploit module for enumerating public Azure services, ```enum_azuresubdomains.rb``` will check for valid Azure subdomains, based off of a base word, via DNS. This reconnaissance and enumeration module rapidly identifies API services, storage accounts, key vaults, databases, and more! Expedite your cloud recon with this handy auxiliary module.

# Anonymously Enumerating Azure Services:

Microsoft makes use of a number of different domains/subdomains for each of their Azure services. From SQL databases to email and SharePoint drives, each service maps to its respective domain/subdomain, and I have included a list of Azure-related domains below:

| Domain | Associated Service |
| --- | --- |
| azurewebsites.net | App Services |
| scm.azurewebsites.net | App Services - Management |
| p.azurewebsites.net | App Services |
| cloudapp.net | App Services |
| file.core.windows.net | Storage Accounts-Files |
| blob.core.windows.net | Storage Accounts-Blobs |
| queue.core.windows.net | Storage Accounts-Queues |
| table.core.windows.net | Storage Accounts-Tables |
| redis.cache.windows.net | Databases-Redis |
| documents.azure.com | Databases-Cosmos DB |
| database.windows.net | Databases-MSSQL |
| vault.azure.net | Key Vaults |
| onmicrosoft.com | Microsoft Hosted Domain |
| mail.protection.outlook.com | Email |
| sharepoint.com | SharePoint |
| azureedge.net | CDN |
| search.windows.net | Search Appliance |
| azure-api.net | API Services |

It may take a while to pay off, but enumerating existing Azure subdomains may be handy for anyone looking to do subdomain takeovers. Subdomain takeovers are usually done the other way around (finding a domain thatâ€™s no longer registered/in use), but by finding the domains now, and keeping tabs on them for later, you may be able to monitor for potential subdomain takeovers.
